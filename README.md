# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering using the Online Retail Dataset
In this project, I have used RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for segmenting the customer in the online retail dataset based on their purchase behavior. 
The dataset contains approximately 541,909 transactions made between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. 
The features included in the dataset were InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity,  InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country. For the data mining algorithm, we have used K-Means clustering, which further refines customer segmentation and identify distinct groups of customers with similar purchase behavior and preferences. 
By identifying these clusters, the company can target their marketing efforts more effectively and tailor their strategies to meet the specific needs and preferences of each customer segment. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior and can help the company to improve customer retention and increase revenue." 
So, k-means clustering can be used to segment customers into groups based on their purchasing behavior and other attributes. One of the main benefits of clustering is that instead of examining the whole client base as a whole, it is fruitful to segment them into clusters and engage them with relevant deals and avoid the churn rate. Also, companies (retailers) can identify their loyal customers and provide discounts for them, and engage with them for their services so that overall satisfaction will increase. also, they can identify less potential customers which will help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
